# Three-column FED exercise

Fork this repository and implement a responsive three-column display using the
supplied starter kit. Designs are provided in Adobe XD and in PNG in the
`comps/` directory.

## What we're looking for

(in order of priority)

1. Your implementation is expected to match the designs exactly in all supported browsers.
2. Your code is well-organized, readable, and maintainable.
3. Third-party libraries are pulled in carefully and only as needed.
4. Browser payload size should be kept to a minimum.

## Requirements

* **You are not allowed to change the HTML `<body>` markup provided in `index.html`**
* Each section of the accordion-style elements should expand on user interaction
* The default state of the accordions should be that all elements are collapsed
* Animations are hardware accelerated
* Implementation works as expected in most recent two versions of Firefox, Chrome, Safari, and Edge

## Recommendations

* Use a CSS preprocessor. We use mostly use PostCSS or LESS. LESS is already set up for you.
* Make the layout fluid for any device or screen resolution.
* Add CSS transitions for the expand/collapse indicator.
* Add CSS transitions to the content/container as the sections are expanded/collapsed.

## Fonts

All fonts used in the design are available on Google Fonts.

* Bree Serif: Block title, post title, post subtitle
* Roboto: Body copy

## Font sizing

* 32px: Block title
* 24px: Post title
* 21px: Post subtitle
* 16px: Body copy

Don't stop here -- look at the designs!
